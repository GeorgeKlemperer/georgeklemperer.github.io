    <h2 id="anchor1">About Me</h2>
    <p> Hi! My name is George, welcome to my website which is also my application project for the Founders and Coders software development bootcamp. Please see my project gallery below for my application portfolio!<br><br>
        
        My background up until now has mostly been in science and academia. I completed a master's in Chemistry at the University of Bristol, where I then went on to do a PhD in Synthetic Biology. During my PhD I spent a year at the University of Oxford where I performed research that went on to be part of a publication in <i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-020-0444-1">Nature Chemistry</a></i>. After finishing my PhD I continued as a postdoctural research assistant in the University of Bristol's Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine working on 3D bioprinting. Here I performed my own research as well as helped PhD students on their own projects. After this I took a year out to go travelling, which included a 6-week cycling tour around France and along the Pyrenees, and a long trip to visit the Philippines (where I was born). <br><br>
    
    In my spare time I greatly enjoy staying active. I play tennis, squash, and football. I run outdoors when it is not wet, and boulder indoors when it is. At university I also did Brazilian jiu jitsu for 3 years. I also love to read, watch foreign and independent films, and listen to music.

    <br><br>
    I have also been a bartender in two different major cities in the UK, been employed as a freelance writer for a music review site, crashed a moped, once cycled 222 km in a day, shaken Ryley Walker's hand, and have swam in Walden Pond. 
    <br><br>
    Here are my answers to some of questions from The Proust Questionnaire, correct as of their date of writing:
    <br><br>

    <strong>What is your favourite flower?</strong><br>
    The bulrush.<br><br>

    <strong>What is your favourite bird?</strong><br>
    The owl.<br><br>

    <strong>What are your favourite names?</strong><br>
    Otto, Teddy, Claire, Fritz.<br><br>

    <strong>What do you consider your greatest achievement?</strong><br>
    I will rephrase this as what is my favourite thing I have written, which would be my haiku called "Summer".<br><br>

<p class="haiku">
    Summer will bring fruit.<br>
    Perhaps I'll make marmalade,<br>
    orange marmalade.
</p>
    
    <br><br>

    <strong>Who are your favourite heroes of fiction?</strong><br>
    Captain John Yossarian, Charlie Gordon, Mr. Stevens, Gatsby, and Getafix.<br><br>

    <strong>What is your favourite colour?</strong><br>
    Orange, sometimes blue. <br><br>

    <strong>Your favourite motto?</strong><br>
    "It doesn't get easier, you just get faster" - Greg LeMond, three-time winner of the Tour de France.

    <h2 id="anchor2">Why I'm Applying</h2>
<p>I'm really excited by the tech sector, and software development specifically. Though I greatly enjoyed my time in academia and the opportunity to teach myself, be creative, and research my own lines of inquiry, I would now like to apply the skills I have learned in a more impactful role. Technology has become a powerful tool in our daily lives, especially through the hyper-interactivity of the web, and coding will be the universal language of the future. I have only just begun learning to code to apply to Founders and Coders but have been really enjoying the problem solving and inventive aspects of it. It has also been really interesting looking under hood at how things work, something I've always found stimulating. I also like the sound of Founders and Coders' cohort and peer learning approach, which reminds me of how PhD students help each other out in the lab with each others projects to learn more as a group. I hope to use the Founders and Coders bootcamp to begin a career in software development.</p>
