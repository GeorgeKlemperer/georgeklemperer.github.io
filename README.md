My main website for my FaC application! It contains some information about me and why I want to join FaC. It also contains my project gallery which links to the other projects in my application portfolio. My favicon is based on a self portrait I made blindfolded during a country retreat:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/selfportrait.jpeg" alt="Self-portrait"
style="display: inline-block; 
margin: 0 auto; 
width: 50%;
max-width: 100%;">
</p>
